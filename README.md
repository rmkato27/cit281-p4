This project involves setting up a Node.js application using Fastify to manage and serve a Q&A (questions and answers) functionality.
It includes creating data files, server setup, and a series of APIs to handle questions and answers, with capabilities for CRUD operationsâ€”create, read, update, and delete.

was able to work with fastify more and practice with its capabitilies and the ease that it allows you to test your webpages with. Again, node.js helps with this as well, but the coding itself helped on the server side part of webpages and well as reading data files, 
which I remember tripping me up a bit during this project.
